**Main Aim:** To help people solve building problems quickly while providing nearby workers with job opportunities and a way to earn money.  
**Target Audience:**

- People who have problems in their buildings and need repairs.

## Minimum MVP Functionality

### 1. Access & Identity

- **Auto-suggest nearest workers** when a request is created

### 3. Creating & Matching Requests

- **Create service request** with problem description and optional image
- **Accept or reject suggested worker** and confirm the order
- **Map view of available workers** for direct selection

### 4. Worker Tools

- **Browse, filter, and apply for jobs**
- **Commit to an assigned job**
- **Contact requester** (phone, email, or in-app message)

### 5. Progress Tracking

- **Status flow:** new → in progress → completed
- **Notifications:** new assignment, status change, job updates

### 6. Insight Dashboards

- **Clients:** active and past requests
- **Workers:** job history and earnings
- **Admins:** user management and system performance
